# ML-Based-Direction-of-Arrival-Estimation
ML-Based Direction-of-Arrival Estimation in Passive Radar. Proposed two novel approaches to improve DoA estimation accuracy under conditions of high noise, fewer sensors, mutual coupling, etc and reduced computational complexity by 50% when compared to existing research. techniques. Utilised ML models to verify the accuracy results of the approach
